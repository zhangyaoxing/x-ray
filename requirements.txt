# ============================================================================
# This file is DEPRECATED - use the split requirements files instead:
#
# - requirements-base.txt: Core dependencies (cross-platform)
# - requirements-ai.txt:   AI dependencies (includes base + AI features)
#
# For normal builds (recommended):
#   make deps        # Uses requirements-base.txt
#   make build       # Build without AI support
#
# For AI-enabled builds:
#   make deps-ai     # Uses requirements-ai.txt  
#   make build-ai    # Build with AI support (experimental)
# ============================================================================

# For backward compatibility, install base requirements:
-r requirements-base.txt
